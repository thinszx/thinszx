### 😊 Hi there, this is Zixin Shang 尚子鑫

I'm currently a master student at [University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), majored in Cyber Science and Technology.

### 😳 More about me

- I received my bachalor degree in Information Security at [Hefei University of Technology](https://en.hfut.edu.cn/) as outstanding graduates.
- I was an intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), [iFlytek](https://www.iflytek.com/), and [H3C](https://www.h3c.com/) Switch Department, all as backend developer.
- My research interest focuses on the applications of mmWave radar involving with deep learning techniques, especially in multi-modal alignment, dataset watermarkering for ownership verification and modern synthesis models(VQVAE-based structure with Transformers and Diffusions). I also have lots of interest in more exciting security research fields like privacy leakage and attacks in LLM and LMs.
- I hate MATLAB(dirty but still efficient...) and just use Python and Golang if I could.

### 😅 Status

Working hard to make this more delightful...
