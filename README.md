### 😊 Hi there, this is Zixin Shang 尚子鑫

I'm currently an algorithm engineer at [iFlytek](https://www.iflytek.com/), specially focusing on the large model training framework and parallel computing.

### 😳 More about me

- I received my bachalor degree in Information Security at [Hefei University of Technology](https://en.hfut.edu.cn/) as outstanding graduates.
- I received my MEng. degree in Cyberspace Security at [University of Science and Technology of China(USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/), specializing in mmWave radar, multimodal Learning, and deep learning security. Visit my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=shxvW8oAAAAJ).
- I was an intern at [Tencent](https://www.tencent.com/), [iFlytek](https://www.iflytek.com/) as backend developer, and [One2X](https://www.one2x.ai/) as a fullstack engineer.
- My research interest focuses on the applications of mmWave radar involving with deep learning techniques, especially in multi-modal alignment, dataset watermarkering for ownership verification and modern synthesis models(VQVAE-based structure with Transformers and Diffusions). [This is my Google Scholar profile.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=shxvW8oAAAAJ) I also have lots of interest in more exciting security research fields like privacy leakage and attacks in LLM and LMs.
- I hate MATLAB(dirty but still efficient...) and just use Python ~~and Golang~~ if I could.

### 😅 Status

Working hard to make this more delightful...
